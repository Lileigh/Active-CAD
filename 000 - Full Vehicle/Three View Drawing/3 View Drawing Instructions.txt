1. Re-copy full car assembly to folder

2. Ensure modified monocoque, aero shield, and full aero assem are current
	a. Monocoque has the mirror suppressed and is saved as a mirror part (left side of car), one body suppressed so it is a shell
	b. Aero shield is cut along the monocoque top surface line
	c. Modified parts and current parts should both be present, with one hidden for each config

3. Rebuild 3VD full car assem to have the three relevant configs
	a. Front view: Normal monocoque, cut aero shield
	b. Top view: Cut monocoque, cut aero shield
	c. Right view: Cut monocoque, normal aero shield

EXPECT PROCESS TO TAKE SEVERAL HOURS

	1. Import model (~1:9)
	2. Set ground plane datum
	3. Set overall, TW, ride height dimensions
	4. Annotate
